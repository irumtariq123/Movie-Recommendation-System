🎥 Movie Recommendation System

📋 Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommendation System, designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user viewing history and preferences. The project leverages Collaborative Filtering techniques to identify patterns in user behavior and recommend movies that align with individual tastes.

The system is aimed at a new streaming platform, with the goal of competing against industry giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime by offering personalized movie suggestions to enhance user engagement.

📊 Project Objectives

Analyze User Preferences: Identify patterns in user behavior, such as the genres they prefer and the types of movies they tend to watch.

Build the Recommendation Model: Use collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based) to create a recommendation system.

Evaluate Recommendations: Measure the effectiveness of recommendations using evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).

📝 Project Details

Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, including detailed movie metadata and credits information.

Modeling Approach

The model employs User-Based Collaborative Filtering using Cosine Similarity to determine user similarities.

Ratings for unseen movies are predicted using weighted averages of ratings from similar users.

Visualizations are provided to better understand user behavior and data distributions.

Evaluation Metrics

The model’s effectiveness is evaluated using:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): Measures how close the predicted ratings are to actual user ratings.

📚 Future Enhancements

To improve the accuracy and robustness of the recommendation system, the following enhancements are suggested:

Content-Based Filtering: Incorporate movie attributes like genres, keywords, and cast information.

Hybrid Models: Combine collaborative and content-based filtering for a more comprehensive recommendation engine.

Deep Learning: Explore neural network approaches to capture complex patterns in user preferences.

Time-Based Analysis: Factor in recent user activities to keep recommendations relevant.
